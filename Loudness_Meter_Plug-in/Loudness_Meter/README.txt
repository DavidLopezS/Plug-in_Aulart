In order to perform a correctly drawn spectrogram we need to use the already exsiting struct FFTDataGenerator so the data of the buffers can be extracted correctly.
Method to extract the data and paint it as an image needs to be analyzed for a further improvement of the spectrogram representation, once this is done a proper callibration must occur.
